			<p class="paragraph"> My name is Daniel Merrill. I'm 23 and I'm from Atlanta, Georgia. I am currently taking the UI design class at the Iron Yard in Austin, Texas. I just moved to Austin a few days ago and don't really know anyone down here, so if anyone ever wants to get a drink after class let me know.
			I love meeting new people and trying all sorts of different things. I like just about every type of food (aside from kale). I love just about every genre of music depending on my mood, however I not much of a country fan; Zach Brown band, Florida Georgia line, and Cory Smith are really the only country artists I like. I like Texas a lot and plan to live down here for the foreseeable future. In the future I hope to get a tech job, start my own business, and one day be a US senator. </p>
